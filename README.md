- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @IAyuso, postdoctoral researcher at the interface between biotechonology, chemistry and bioinformatics.
- ðŸ‘€ My interests are wide-scope, ranging from phylogenetics to computational chemistry, but everything oriented to make our world cleaner and more sustainable.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Python and bash coding to automate my research, so my github will be mainly snippets and smalls scripts that have been useful for me.
